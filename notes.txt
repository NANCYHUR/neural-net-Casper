-------- inspiration ----------
abstract:
This paper conducts experiments on geographical data using neural networks.
It compares the performances of various network structures with different optimization techniques.
It demonstrates that Casper networks generalises better than standard predetermined neural networks
but does not benefit much from bimodal distribution reductions.
when the dataset is very limited

-------- feedback from assignment 1 ------------
abstract section:
problem, motivation, approaches, contributions
why they are being compared

introduction section:
geographical data important -> need reference
background of techniques in introduction section
mention the 5 output categories
pre-processing should belong to methods section

methods section:
details about CasPer and all hyperparameters
why hidden neuron 12? reference
methods chapter should include details about evaluation (and justification)
cross validation described in separate sub-section
"5-fold cross-validation" than "5 cross validation"
dont' talk about how to implement in Pytorch

results section:
more details about results achieved
√ NN seems overfitting
X chapter 3 include average and best
caption, brief description for tables and figures
issues should belong to the results and discussion chapter
avoid in-text citation

conclusion section:
future work should be possible extensions/ addressing the flaws/ perfecting techniques

-------------------------- assignment 1 ------------------------------- 
Your task is to:
1. devise a classification or regression problem to investigate using the data set
provided – this can be reproducing, extending or modifying the problem which is
described in the paper related to that dataset;

some notes of rules:
(1) similar inputs have similar outputs
(2) 

notes on GIS:
(1) 190 points, 16 values, last 5 are forest supra-type
(2) plot number, 
	aspect, 
	sin of aspect, 
	cos of aspect, 
	altitude, 
	topographic position,
	slope degree, 
	geology descr, 
	rainfall, 
	temperature, 
	landsat band tm1, 
	landsat band tm2, 
	landsat band tm3, 
	landsat band tm4, 
	landsat band tm5
	landsat band tm6, 
	landsat band tm7, 

	scrub, 
	dry sclerophyll, 
	wet-dry sclero,
	wet sclero, 
	rain forest

(3) aspect: 0 float, 10 north, 20 ne, 30 east, ..., 70 west, 80 nw
	topographic position: 32 gully, 48 lower slope, 64 mid-slope, 80 upper slope
				96 ridge
	slope degree: 10: <1%, 20: <2.15%, 30: <4.64%, 40: <10%,
			50: <21.5%, 60: <46.4%, 70: <100%, 80: >100%
	geology descriptor: unknown encoding
	rainfall: (mm-801)/5
	temperature: (degrees-11)*30
	landsat tm bands 1 to 7: values in range 0 to 256

(4) network design considerations
	topology: keep size of network as small as possible to avoid overfitting (input, hidden or output neutrons)



2. implement a neural network in PyTorch / Python to solve the problem and
implement a method to determine the performance of the neural network;

3. implement a technique from the literature (paper selected as described above) and
determine its benefit or lack of benefit;




4. compare your results with results published in a research paper reporting results on
the data set you chose (see below); and






5. write a report on your work
