Your task is to:
1. devise a classification or regression problem to investigate using the data set
provided â€“ this can be reproducing, extending or modifying the problem which is
described in the paper related to that dataset;






2. implement a neural network in PyTorch / Python to solve the problem and
implement a method to determine the performance of the neural network;




3. implement a technique from the literature (paper selected as described above) and
determine its benefit or lack of benefit;




4. compare your results with results published in a research paper reporting results on
the data set you chose (see below); and






5. write a report on your work
