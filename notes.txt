Your task is to:
1. devise a classification or regression problem to investigate using the data set
provided â€“ this can be reproducing, extending or modifying the problem which is
described in the paper related to that dataset;

some notes of rules:
(1) similar inputs have similar outputs
(2) 

notes on GIS:
(1) 190 points, 16 values, last 5 are forest supra-type
(2) plot number, 
	aspect, 
	sin of aspect, 
	cos of aspect, 
	altitude, 
	topographic position,
	slope degree, 
	geology descr, 
	rainfall, 
	temperature, 
	landsat band tm1, 
	landsat band tm2, 
	landsat band tm3, 
	landsat band tm4, 
	landsat band tm5
	landsat band tm6, 
	landsat band tm7, 

	scrub, 
	dry sclerophyll, 
	wet-dry sclero,
	wet sclero, 
	rain forest

(3) aspect: 0 float, 10 north, 20 ne, 30 east, ..., 70 west, 80 nw
	topographic position: 32 gully, 48 lower slope, 64 mid-slope, 80 upper slope
				96 ridge
	slope degree: 10: <1%, 20: <2.15%, 30: <4.64%, 40: <10%,
			50: <21.5%, 60: <46.4%, 70: <100%, 80: >100%
	geology descriptor: unknown encoding
	rainfall: (mm-801)/5
	temperature: (degrees-11)*30
	landsat tm bands 1 to 7: values in range 0 to 256

(4) network design considerations
	topology: keep size of network as small as possible to avoid overfitting (input, hidden or output neutrons)



2. implement a neural network in PyTorch / Python to solve the problem and
implement a method to determine the performance of the neural network;

3. implement a technique from the literature (paper selected as described above) and
determine its benefit or lack of benefit;




4. compare your results with results published in a research paper reporting results on
the data set you chose (see below); and






5. write a report on your work
